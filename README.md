**Asriel Place**: This bot works for this project by default, no need to change anything.

**Other projects**: Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AmUVTBST) if you'd like to add your project to our bot.

## Check installation

Make sure your place button has black text. If your button also says `Azzy Bot!` or have the stripe background, then that's also a good sign.

## Update

When updates are available, a popup will appear:

Click update, click on update in the new tab, and **refresh your r/place tab**.
