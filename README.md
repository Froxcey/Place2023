# Azzy Bot 2023

Independently developed 2023 r/place bot by Froxcey for the [Asriel place Discord server](https://discord.gg/AmUVTBST).

## Installation

1. Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Install [this](https://github.com/Froxcey/Place2023/raw/master/placeAzzy.user.js)
3. Go [here](https://reddit.com/r/place)

**Asriel Place**: This bot works for this project by default, no need to change anything.

**Asriel BG**: Click [me](https://github.com/Froxcey/Place2023/raw/master/placeAzzy_azzy-bg.user.js) to enable the Asriel BG project.

**Other projects**: Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AmUVTBST) if you'd like to add your project to our bot.

> ❗ Important
> Don't leave the tab in background, leave it in a dedicated window (the window can be in background). Reddit unloads the website to save resources when the tab is in background, and it can interrupt the bot.

## Check installation

Make sure your place button has black text. If your button also says `Azzy Bot!` or have the stripe background, then that's also a good sign.
